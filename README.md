## Data type (2 points) 
csv file

## How did you get your prototype working? (7 points)
I modified the code provided by Michael and made it so that the measured data could be easily average and callibrated over time (and added to a .csv file).  I also looked at multiple libraries written by individuals that are supposed to look at attributes like frequency, period, etc.  Unfortunately, there are some differences between their setup and my own, so I'm still trying to understand these variations.   The idea is that once I can measure frequency, I can apply an algorithm to guess the key of a piece based on the common frequencies (notes). 

## Arduino Code (10 points)
I've been working on the following files:
frequencyReader.ino
frequencyReader2.ino
frequencyReader3.ino

## Data Sample (7 points)
datalog.csv

## How did you collect this data? (5 points)
The data attached shows the results of my varying experiments, which continued tacking the formatted results to the end of the file.

## What signal do you think is in your data? (3 points)
I'd like to pull the frequency of the waves from the data.

## How fun was this mini-project? (3 points)
7

## How hard was it? (3 points)
8

## How much did you learn from the experience? (3 points)
