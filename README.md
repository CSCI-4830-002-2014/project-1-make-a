## Data type (2 points) 
csv

## How did you get your prototype working? (7 points)
I made no modifications to the code to get it working. I simply left the sample rate the same and uploaded the code.

## Arduino Code (10 points)
sound_sensor_p1.ino

## Data Sample (7 points)
datalogparty1.csv

## How did you collect this data? (5 points)
I thought a good sample for this project would be to record sound during a party we threw at our house. There is a table we have next to the coach in the living room. I chose this as the area for data collection because conversation was there the entire duration of the party. Now we have data for when during the night it got loudest. This can be used as an estimate for when would be the most lively time during the party. 

## What signal do you think is in your data? (3 points)
We can do some cool ratio analytics to determine at what point in the party it is loudest. Is it 30 minutes after the official event began or is it two hours in just before everyone leaves? 

## How fun was this mini-project? (3 points) (10 being most fun)
8 (Love begin able to see my efforts come to life immediatly

## How hard was it? (3 points)
4 (Some difficulties with soldering to begin)

## How much did you learn from the experience? (3 points)
5 (soldering was fairly new for me)
