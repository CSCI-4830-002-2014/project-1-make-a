## How did you collect this data? (5 points)
The sensor was in our living room near our window. It was used to monitor our dog and see if she was barking while we were not home.

## What signal do you think is in your data? (3 points)
There seems to be a steady increase of volume during certain times of the day, and drops at other times. This might indicate night and day. After looking at those general patterns, you can see spikes throughout the day when no one should be home, indicating that our dog is indeed most likely barking when she shouldn't be.
