# Data type
CSV

# How did you get your prototype working?
I added a Time library so that I could output a more readable time format for when each reading was collected. Unfortunately, I couldn't figure out how to get the arduino to sync to the PC time, so it simply reports HH:mm:ss since turned on.

# Arduino Code
[sound_sensor.ino](sound_sensor/sound_sensor.ino)
[Time.h](sound_sensor/time.h)

# Data Sample
[DATALOG.csv](DATALOG.csv)

# How did you collect this data?
On Friday evening, we had a party and I kept the sound sensor near the speakers to see how the music loudness changed throughout the night. I turned the sensor on around 8pm and it collected data for a little over 4 hours before the battery died.

# What signal do you think is in your data?
The data should show that loudness increased around 11pm when more people came over, so the music was loud and there were many people talking. 

# How fun was this mini-project? 
10

# How hard was it? 
3

# How much did you learn from the experience?
5 ( I had previous experience with Arduinos )
