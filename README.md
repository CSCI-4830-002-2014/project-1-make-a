## How did you get your prototype working? (7 points)
I added a column in the CSV monitoring seconds passed using a now() function from Arduino's time library.
I also added a column for the day of the week that the data was being recorded.

## How did you collect this data? (5 points)
Every day for four days I recorded sound starting at 6:00pm and brought the Arduino with me to see if there was a certain time of night I was in the loudest setting.

## What signal do you think is in your data? (3 points)
I hypothesize that the data will show later hours of the night as being louder on average while thursday and sunday will be quieter than friday and saturday.
