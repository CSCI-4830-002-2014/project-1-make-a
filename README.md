## Hardware Photo (7 points)

## Data type (2 points)
Currently, the data is being stored as a .csv file. I'm not the biggest fan of this type, but I figure it worked well for this case where we are only tracking sound values and indices. I would be interested in getting it setup as a JSON file in the future.

## How did you get your prototype working? (7 points)
I didn't change all that much. Mostly I was looking for a way to track the time as I collected data. I did this by manually including a date title each time the machine was re-initialized, as well as keep a second tracker for every tenth data point collected.

## Arduino Code (10 points)
[myArdu.ino](myArdu.ino)

## Data Sample (7 points)
I collected three sets of data, each over a 4 hour period. One of them got "corrupted" about 30 minutes in for reasons that are still unknown to me, but I think it would be fun to keep the file and see what I can do with it regardless. All of the samples are in the [Samples](samples) folder.

## How did you collect this data? (5 points)
I was curious to see how the sound in my apartment changed as my roommates and I came and left. I really wanted to track it during the school week when I would be gone to find out when my roommates were home and talking, but the weekend was just as fun. You could tell how quiet it was in the mornings and early afternoons and how much louder it got at night. It was fun to see a common trend.

## What signal do you think is in your data? (3 points)
Finding trends in the activity of the main living space of my apartment. tracking the date and time will also help to discover when the place is loud because of talking, because of dishes, etc. and when it is quiet because of vacancy, when people are sleeping, etc.

## How fun was this mini-project? (3 points)
9 - I had never truly worked with hardware before this assignment. Although much of the physical work and code was done for us, it was so rewarding to have been part of building something and using it to collect data for yourself. I can't wait to see how we can use this for bigger more sophisticated projects. I loved this intro lesson.

## How hard was it? (3 points)
3 - Like I said, most of the "hard" work was done for us seeing as how this was an introduction to Arduino. With that said, it was a bit daunting to wrap my mind around how the hardware was built and how it interacts with the software. Prior to this, I had only ever dealt with software, but now that I have a general sense of what I'm working with, its fantastic to be building with this.

## How much did you learn from the experience? (3 points)
8 - This was exciting. I don't know if I can say that enough, haha. It didn't take long to figure out once I just sat down and read through it, and Arduino's online documentation if a great source of new information. Can't wait to do more!
