## Hardware Photo (7 points)
Phone stopped working over the weekend, will upload when I can, but it looks comparable to everyone else's during the lab when we soldered them.

## Data type (2 points) 
How is your data being saved - csv

## How did you get your prototype working? (7 points)
I only used the part to write to the file mostly.  I looked up the sensor device and it came with some simple sample code to take data.

## Arduino Code (10 points)
[Replace the sample arduino code in this repo with the your arduino code, then put the name of your file here]

## Data Sample (7 points)
[Replace the sample data file in this repo with your data file, then put the name of your file here]

## How did you collect this data? (5 points)
I set it outside on a balcony to get sunlight.  As I excpeted most of the data was maxing out the sensor, because it was in the sun.  However, upon further reading it seems these types of sensors might react extra sensitively to UV light, so it would be best to get data indoors.

## What signal do you think is in your data? (3 points)
I do not understand what you mean by what signal.  If you are referring to patterns, then my data has a very smooth flow because it slowly gets stronger and stronger over the day out on the balcony from sunlight.

I want to setup the sensor above a door where it is not very bright inside, and the door leads outside.  This would give more random, unsystemic data.

## How fun was this mini-project? (3 points)
8, I very much enjoyed learning how to set this up.  I hope to rerun this experiment in order to gather more unique data for light.

## How hard was it? (3 points)
2

## How much did you learn from the experience? (3 points)
6 tentatively.  This gave me many other ideas of projects with other sensors that I hope to explore.
